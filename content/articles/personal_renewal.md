Title: Personal Renewal
Date: 2012-09-05
Category: Errata

If you've visited my site before, you'll undoubtably notice that
the look has changed dramatically. This is not merely a new theme,
but a complete reinvention.

My site started out running Wordpress, with an inexpensive
commercial theme. That worked great for me for a while, as I set to
build a branded personal image as an expert in the Interet Marketing
community. After a while, I realized that I really didn't have the
passionate to write about my IM experiences on a regular enough
basis to justify building my image around it, so I switched to the
Wordpress default *Twenty Eleven* theme.

I really liked (and still like) *Twenty Eleven*. In fact, I still
have commercial sites using the template, such as [Photography
Basics 101][pb101]. The theme is fairly minimal without being
extreme, allows a high degree of customization, and has actually
performed very well in terms of conversion rate. Best of all, it's
incredibly easy to update and I never have to worry about the theme
designer not keeping up with with it. If *Twenty Eleven* doesn't
get updated and hasn't been replaced, then I'll be too busy looking
for a viable replacement to Wordpress to mourn for the theme.

New Site
========

My new site was more complex to set up, but is refreshingly simple
to maintain. It's statically generated using [Pelican][pelican],
which is a Python module designed for blogging. Both the 
[source I use to build the site][gh_source] and the 
[resultant markup][gh_html] are hosted on Github.

Best yet, *this site itself* is hosted on Github, using Github Pages.
No server administration headache or transfer protocol to deal with.
I use two tools for this site: Sublime Text 2 for writing content 
(in Markdown or ReST, no less), and Git for versioning and deployment.

It's very refreshing to be able to go from hacking on a Python
project to writing a blog post without changing tools. This sort of
shared toolchain is something that I'm cultivating in my life right
now, in an attempt to embed myself more fully in the Open-Source
Software Movement and the Python community in particular.

If this concept is sound, I hope you'll see more of this type of
post from me, just running down what I'm working on and why. I
intend to make this site a sort of public accountability tool, 
forcing me to harness the passion I feel but find so difficult
to express in my daily actions. If I can put my thoughts down in
writing where others can read them, perhaps I can preserve enough
of the initial excitement associated with them to turn them into
something that I can offer to the community with the pride of a
man who has built something to be proud of.
