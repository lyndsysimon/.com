Title: Defining Gittip's Scope

Category: Gittip

When I first heard of Gittip, I remember being blown away by its implications.
The concept that an open source developer could sever ties with the corporate
world entirely, and rely instead on the small but consistent contributions of
the community which they support is very powerful.

If this takes off, no longer will the direction of projects important to the
community as a whole be dictated by corporate sponsors with their own internal
agenda. Re-organizations and changes in leadership would not threaten an
important and potentially revolutionary project with the loss of the vast
majority of their funding. This is still exciting to me, and I sincerely hope
that I will one day be able to point to my small involvement in Gittip as an
example to my children of where individual contributions can change the world.

Even so, in watching the discussion around the project on Github and elsewhere,
I've begun to realize that this is much, much bigger than changing the economy
of open source.

Gittip is poised to change the world.

It's easy, as a developer, to point to examples within the community of fairly
well-known individuals who contribute greatly without that activity being their
primary source of income. Some have corporate benefactors (see
[Kenneth Reitz](http://kennethreitz.com "Kenneth Reitz") of
[Heroku](http://heroku.com/ "Heroku") and [John Resig](ejohn.org) of
[Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org "Khan Academy") - funded by
Google and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), some work day jobs and make
contributions during a portion of their time, and some work entirely on their
own, outside their day jobs. These people need a means of support, and with the
support of the community, Gittip can be that means.

We are only _one community_, though. How about musicians? Are there people out
there creating source files and distributing them for free? Writers?
Architects? My wife makes hairbows, and has built a moderately successful and
growing business from it. She learned much of that skill from tutorials written
by forum members in her world, and from YouTube. Who funds those people? What
motivates them to keep creating? More importantly - what would the world be
like if every tiny community had a small core of people whose primary job was
the advancement of the things that community cares about?

There isn't a community in existence that wouldn't benefit from these people
having more time and energy to expend on what they wanted.

In my opinion, capturing this energy across multiple verticals is the path to
the future for Gittip. We need to raise awareness in countless commmunities, to
show that this platform will allow people to make small and individually
insignificant contributions that will, when combined with others in their
community, create a very real and very significant benefit to the lives of the
people who care about what they care about.
