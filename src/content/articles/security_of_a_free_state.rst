:Title: The Security of a Free State

The tragedy that occurred at Sandy Hook is still fresh in the minds of parents
around the country, and rightfully so. A classroom full of Kindergarteners was
gunned down by a deranged, psychopathic killer in the days before Christmas.

Within this great tragedy lies a smaller, more personal one for me. On the day
of the massacre, I was busy at work and didn't hear until the afternoon. My
first response *should* have been sadness and sympathy - and indeed, I felt
those emotions. Tempering them, though, was an anger at those in the political
sphere who I knew would use the deaths of two dozen innocents as an opportunity
to lessen my own ability to protect my family.

It was only a few hours between the murderer killing himself and my coming
upon the news online, but in that time the left's calls for gun control were
already in full force. There was evidently no period for grief required for
them - there were press conferences to hold, offensive messages to tweet, and
accusations to be made.

In contrast, the NRA's response was silence. They said nothing, and closed
their Facebook page to comment when it became clear that the discourse there
would not remain civil. Nearly a week passed before a public statement was
made. In that time, they put together a strategy to lessen the possibility for
this to happen again, and to limit the death toll when it does.

Notice I said "when it does" - because it will happen again. It will happen
again because there is evil in this world, and that evil will never be
eliminated. Instead, we face a choice - to curtail the freedoms of the just,
and to limit their ability to effectively defend themselves and their families;
or to do all that is possible to be sure that the next time it does happen, the
potential victims of the attack are defended as well as reasonably possible.

Unmolested Slaughter
````````````````````

To date, America has chosen the first path. We've passed laws like the Federal
Gun Free School Zone Act and Connecticut's own "Assault Weapon" Ban. They have
had no measurable impact on violent crime, and have instead rendered our
children undefended.

Consider the recent extreme case in Norway - despite very
onerous firearms law, an individual (who I will not name, there is no need to
make him better known than he is) went through a lengthly legal process to
apply for an own a rifle and handgun. He trained, gather materials, and planned
his massacre for many, many months. Not one of the laws managed to stop this
monster - indeed, he seemed to take a perverse pride in following them, in
order not to arouse suspicion.  After detonating an explosive device in Oslo,
he arrived in Ut√∏ya and slaughtered dozens of children and met no substantive
resistance.

Limiting access to firearms does not help prevent mass murder.

The Alternate Path
``````````````````
The second path is one of proactive defense. Instead of limiting access to
weapons, we could do the opposite, and be sure our children have armed security
protecting them. This is a sound concept - as NRA President Wayne LaPierre
said on *Meet the Press*, "the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is
a good guy with a gun."

Still, this path is one that we should tread very, very carefully. Armed
guards in schools will certainly help deter and limit the scope of these events
in the future - but at what cost? Do we really want the next generation of
Americans to grow up accustomed to leaving home and entering an armed compound,
with uniformed agents of the state standing guard? What will that do to the
*culture* of this country? I shudder to consider. If we aren't fully aware of
this threat and prepared to defend against it, we will first see the rise of
the "TSA for Schools", followed by a generation of voters who look to
government as a legitimate provider of their most basic needs - including the
protection of our children.

If not a government program, then what is the solution? Let us look at our
Constitution for the answer. The Second Amendment, specifically:

    "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state,
    the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."

For decades, advocates for firearms freedoms have pointed to the second part of
this statement as the meat of the Amendment - "the right of the people...".
This is well and good, because those who sought to limit those freedoms pointed
to the first half - "A well regulated militia..." - in an effort to say that
this was the *only* use for arms.

Today, America needs to take another look at that first half. As Americans, we
have the right to keep and bear arms. If you ask why, you'll get a variety of
answers, ranging from "hunting" to "to provide the People the future ability
to throw off their government". These answers are all true, at least partially
- but the fact is, there is one use for arms that is *explicitly* laid out for
us - to assure "the security of a free state".

What we face today is a security problem, there's no question. We have tried to
ensure that security by limiting access to weapons, and that hasn't worked. Now
we are discussing attempting to ensure that security by looking to government
to provide armed guards in schools. Before we do this, let's try the simple
solution to the problem, laid out in plain English over two centuries ago by
the very men who created the single most successful system of government to
ever grace the face of the Earth - let's rely on a "well regulated militia."

A Well Regulated Militia
````````````````````````

In 18th Century parlance, "well regulated" meant something akin to "regulating"
the flow of water through a pipe. It meant to make something uniform and
reliable.

Further, Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution gives Congress the power:

    "To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union,
    suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;

    To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for
    governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United
    States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the
    Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the
    discipline prescribed by Congress;"

So then - we have a mechanism already in place to deal with this type of thing.
Certainly providing security within the local community is something best dealt
with within that community, and Congress clearly has the power to establish
and organize a body of individuals within our communities to employ in those
occassions where there is a need for them. State governments are reserved much
control over this group, in that they are responsible for choosing its
leadership and training regimen. Who, then, are the Militia?

The Militia Act of 1903 defined three classes of American military forces, with
the "unorganized militia" among them. The unorganized milita consists of
"all able-bodied men between 18 and 45" [#DickAct]_. Taken together, the solution to the problem of security in schools (and other
areas, including the role currently played by the TSA) is simple: Congress
should set aside funds for a civilian militia, and develop a high-level
training doctrine against which the states much implement specific training.

Our schools, our airports, and our nation in general should be protected by
the very people whom the government is in place to protect - the citizens.
There is no need for a Federal agency, a new branch of law enforcement, or even
a program to train a class of citizens as professional armed guards. Instead,
we must re-assert that the individual citizens of this nation have the power,
ability and authority to protect their own, and are indeed responsible for the
defense of their own communities.
